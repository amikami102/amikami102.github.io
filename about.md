As of April 2019, I am a PhD student in the political science department at Boston University. After starting the program in 2015, I came to terms with the fact that I was not so interested in politics. Fortunately, I found myself feeling comfortable with using and learning R and Python and am preparing to apply to jobs that use those skills. 

## How this blog came out to be

Inspired by [Dave Robinson's blogpost](http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/), I built this blog using Mark Otto's [Lanyon theme](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) for Jekyll. To get quickly started on building a Jekyll website hosted on your Github page, I referred to Barry Clark's article, ["Build a Blog with Jekyll and Github Pages"](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) on *Smashing Magazine*. I use Visual Studio to write my blog posts.
